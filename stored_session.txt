Ok, so here is the summary of the info you provided: 
1. Triggers: inflation (INF), trade war (TW), oil supply disrupted (OSD)
2. Controls: None
3. Risk Events: market correction (MC)
4. Mitigators: hedging strategies (HS)
5. Consequences: investment loss (IL)
6. Edges: INF -> MC, TW -> MC, OSD -> MC, HS -> IL, MC -> IL
Thank you. I'll start creating the Bayesian Network now.
