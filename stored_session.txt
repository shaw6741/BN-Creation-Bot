Ok, I understand. I'll derive the edges from our conversation. The summary is: 
1. Triggers: inflation (IN), trade war (TW)
2. Controls: None
3. Risk Events: market correction (MC)
4. Mitigators: buying straddles (BS)
5. Consequences: return loss (RL)
6. Edges: IN -> MC, TW -> MC, MC -> RL, BS -> RL
Thank you. I'll start creating...
User:you can derive it from conversation
Bot:Ok, so the mitigator for the consequence of market correction is buying straddles. Can you tell me what the edges are for this Bayesian Network?
User:i can buy straddles
Bot:
Ok, so the consequence of market correction is return loss. Can you tell me what the mitigators are for this consequence?
User:return loss
Bot:
Ok, so there are no controls for this risk event. Can you tell me what the consequences of this risk event are?
User:none for now
Bot:
Ok, so the triggers for market correction are inflation and trade war. Can you tell me what the controls are for this risk event?
User:inflation, trade war
Bot:
Ok, so the risk event is market correction. Can you tell me what the triggers for this risk event are?
User:market correction
Bot:
Hi there! I'm a robot here to help you create a Bayesian Network to assess the risk of event(s). Can you tell me about the risk event(s) you want to assess?
User:hi
