Okay, I understand that I can derive the edges from the conversation. Thank you. I'll start creating the Bayesian Network with the following information: 
1. Triggers: inflation (IN), trade war (TW), oil supply disrupted (OSD)
2. Controls: None
3. Risk Events: market correction (MC)
4. Mitigators: hedging strategies (HS)
5. Consequences: investment loss (IL)
6. Edges: IN -> MC, TW -> MC, OSD -> MC, MC -> IL, HS -> IL
Thank you. I'll start creating the Bayesian Network now.
User:i think you can derive it from the conversation
Bot: Okay, so you have hedging strategies that could be used to reduce the risk of a market correction. Can you tell me about the edges that should be included in the Bayesian Network?
User:i have heding strategies
Bot: Okay, so the consequence of a market correction is investment loss. Can you tell me about the mitigator(s) that could be used to reduce the risk of a market correction?
User:investment loss
Bot:
Okay, so there are no controls for now. Can you tell me about the consequence(s) of a market correction?
User:no controls for now
Bot:
Okay, so the triggers that could cause a market correction are inflation, trade war, and oil supply disrupted. Can you tell me about the control(s) that could be used to prevent a market correction?
User:inflation, trade war, oil supply disrupted
Bot:
Okay, so the risk event you want to assess is a market correction. Can you tell me about the trigger(s) that could cause a market correction?
User:market correction

Hi there! I'm a robot here to help you create a Bayesian Network to assess the risk of event(s). Can you tell me about the risk event(s) you want to assess?
User:hi
