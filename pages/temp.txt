 Below is the instruction on asking questions.
            Q1. Which state has a lower probability: "{missing_nodes_name}" or Not {missing_nodes_name}?
            Q2. The follow-up question you should ask is;
            Based on the lower probability state, you should ask 
            "If relative weight of (previous answer) is 1, what is the relative weight of (opposite of previous answer)?".
